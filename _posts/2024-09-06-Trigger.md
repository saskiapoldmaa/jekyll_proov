The trigger system is built upon the TDAQ. Basically, you can assume that particles are fast but sparse enough so that there is usually only a single particle in the DUT at a given time. This means that if all of your detectors are measuring a signal at the same time, then it is likely due to the same particle. Also, how we can check if something happens at the same time is using an electrical signal (just like how coincidence works). In our case, we had two scintillators as the trigger. They were upstream of the DUT and as a particle passed them, they would flip a switch from "BUSY" to "NOT BUSY". The detectors downstream were
Not everything that a detector measures is actually a signal from the event we're interested in (like a muon passing a scintillator). One way to filter out the junk is with data analysis and this entails noting down all of the datapoints you were able to measure. Filtering out most of the unnecessary stuff is very eay sthough, so it would make more sense to get rid of it before the data is ever stored. The "getting rid of it" is done by a trigger system which in its core is just a relay logic. 
For example, a trigger system that I could've used instead of burdening the Arduino, is recording only voltage signals that exceed some threshold voltage.
