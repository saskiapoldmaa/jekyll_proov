The trigger system is built upon the TDAQ. Basically, you can assume that particles are fast but sparse enough so that there is usually only a single particle in the DUT at a given time. This means that if all of your detectors are measuring a signal at the same time, then it is likely due to the same particle. Also, how we can check if something happens at the same time is using an electrical signal (just like how coincidence works). In our case, we had two scintillators as the trigger. They were upstream of the DUT and as a particle passed them, they would flip a switch from "BUSY" to "NOT BUSY". The detectors downstream were
