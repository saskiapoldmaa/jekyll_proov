Cherenkov detectors, also known by the abbreviation XCET in our experiment, are gas-filled detectors designed to determinine if a charged particle passing through them exceeds a specific cutoff momentum. If the particle is faster than the phase velocity of light in that gas, the gas will emit light (the principle that nothing can be faster than light only applies to the group velocity of light, not the phase velocity).

The threshold momentum is regulated by the pressure in the detector. The higher the pressure, the higher is the refractive index and the slower does light travel in that medium. Hence, to raise the threshold momentum for particles, you need to decrease the pressure (so increase to decrease!).

By using two Cherenkov detectors at different pressures, with two distinct momentum cutoffs for light emission, you can identify all particles within the momentum range defined by the cutoff momenta of each detector. A particle will fall into this momentum range if it emits light in one Cherenkov detector but not in the other.

To map the momentum of all particles in the beam, i.e. to measure the particles' spectrum, you need to perform a so-called pressure scan. For this, only one Cherenkov detector is necessary, but you need to vary the pressure in it from maximum to minimum. This can be done by initially pumping the detector full of gas and taking measurements while it gradually depressurizes.

The results of pressure scans are usually given by # of particles in a spill that made the medium emit light. You get an idea of what fraction of particles emitted light by comparing this to the trigger rate - the total number of particles in a spill. This is a sample pressure scan from our testbeam:

Here, the x-axis represents the pressure in the Cherenkov detector in bars. On the y-axis is the Cherenkov efficiency.
The efficiency of a Cherenkov detector is truly not an efficiency; it is actually the fraction of particles that emit light or

$$\eta=\frac{\text{Light-emitting particles per spill}}{\text{Trigger rate}}$$

As you can see from the previous picture, at low pressure the threshold momentum is very high, so there are few particles that actually get detected, but as the pressure increases, the momentum becomes less and less discriminating, so more particles are detected.

Pressure scans are more useful after you've translated the x-axis from pressure to threshold momentum.Because particle energies usually follow a normal distribution, the 50% efficiency usually responds to the peak of the spectrum.
